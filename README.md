# FlySphere : Airways Management and Reservation System (CLI-Based)

Project Overview

The Airways Management and Reservation System is a terminal-based, menu-driven application developed to simulate core airline reservation and management operations. The project focuses on backend logic, database design, and real-world booking workflows, rather than graphical interfaces.
It enables users to manage passenger details, flight schedules, and bookings, while ensuring data consistency and preventing duplicate reservations through structured logic.
